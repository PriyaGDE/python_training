1. Completed the Udemy course given in the link below. Unchecked all boxes and gone through all lessons.
   All the codes were solved by me without referring to solutions, except for the topics of images, email, working with CSV and PDF files, and Milestone Project 2, for which I did refer to the solutions for the exercises.
   All the remaining challenges and assessments are solved based on lessons or by conducting a Google search to resolve the issue.
